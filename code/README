This program was completed using pair programming.
Steven Cruz (sicruz@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Jason Ou (jaou@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Steven Cruz spent 5 hours working alone.
Jason Ou spent 6 hours working alone.
We spent 15 hours working together.
Steven Cruz spent 8 hours driving.
Jason Ou spent 7 hours driving.

Please grade the work submitted by sicruz@ucsc.edu
and not the work submitted by jaou@ucsc.edu.
